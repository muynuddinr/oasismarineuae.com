# Product Slug Implementation

## Overview
Changed product detail URLs from ID-based to slug-based for better SEO and user experience.

### Before
```
/products/detail/68c29a3186b80bd0e98b77c0
```

### After
```
/products/detail/caps
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Update
**File:** `src/lib/db.ts`
- Added `slug?: string` field to `IProduct` interface

### 2. Slug Utility Functions
**File:** `src/utils/slug.ts` (NEW)
- `generateSlug(text: string)`: Converts text to URL-friendly slug
  - Converts to lowercase
  - Removes special characters
  - Replaces spaces with hyphens
  - Handles multiple hyphens
- `generateUniqueSlug(baseSlug, existingSlugs)`: Ensures slug uniqueness

### 3. Product Model Updates
**File:** `src/models/Product.ts`
- Added `findBySlug(slug: string)`: Find product by slug
- Added `findByIdOrSlug(identifier: string)`: Find by slug OR ID (backwards compatible)

### 4. API Route Update
**File:** `src/app/api/products/[id]/route.ts`
- Updated GET endpoint to accept both slugs and IDs
- Uses `findByIdOrSlug()` method for backwards compatibility
- Removed strict ObjectId validation

### 5. Product Links Update
**File:** `src/components/ClientCategoryPage.tsx`
- Updated product interface to include `slug?: string`
- Changed product detail links to use slug with fallback:
  ```tsx
  href={`/products/detail/${product.slug || product.name.toLowerCase().replace(/[^\w\s-]/g, '').replace(/\s+/g, '-').replace(/-+/g, '-')}`}
  ```

### 6. Slug Generation API
**File:** `src/app/api/products/generate-slugs/route.ts` (NEW)
- POST endpoint to generate slugs for existing products
- Processes all products without slugs
- Returns statistics: total, updated, skipped, errors

## Backwards Compatibility

The implementation maintains full backwards compatibility:
- Old ID-based URLs still work: `/products/detail/68c29a3186b80bd0e98b77c0`
- New slug-based URLs work: `/products/detail/caps`
- `findByIdOrSlug()` method tries slug first, then falls back to ID

## Migration Steps

### For Existing Products
Run the slug generation endpoint to add slugs to all existing products:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/products/generate-slugs
```

Or use a browser/API client to visit:
```
POST http://localhost:3000/api/products/generate-slugs
```

Response example:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Slug generation complete",
  "stats": {
    "total": 150,
    "updated": 150,
    "skipped": 0,
    "errors": 0
  }
}
```

### For New Products
When creating new products via admin panel, the slug should be:
1. Auto-generated from product name, OR
2. Manually entered by admin (recommended for SEO control)

## SEO Benefits

1. **Better URLs**: Readable, descriptive URLs instead of IDs
2. **Keyword Rich**: Product names in URLs help search engines
3. **User Friendly**: Users can understand URL content at a glance
4. **Social Sharing**: More appealing when shared on social media

## Testing

### Test Cases
1. ✅ Product detail page loads with slug
2. ✅ Product detail page loads with old ID (backwards compatibility)
3. ✅ Product links in category pages use slugs
4. ✅ Special characters in product names are handled correctly
5. ✅ Slug generation API processes all products

### Manual Testing
1. Navigate to any product category
2. Click on a product
3. Check URL - should show slug instead of ID
4. Copy URL and paste in new tab - should load correctly
5. Replace slug with old product ID - should still work

## Future Enhancements

1. **Admin Panel**: Add slug field to product create/edit form
2. **Slug Validation**: Ensure slugs are unique before saving
3. **Redirect**: Add permanent redirects from old ID URLs to new slug URLs
4. **Slug History**: Track slug changes for SEO purposes
5. **Custom Slugs**: Allow admins to customize slugs independently of product names

## Files Modified

- ✅ `src/lib/db.ts` - Added slug to IProduct interface
- ✅ `src/utils/slug.ts` - Created slug utility functions
- ✅ `src/models/Product.ts` - Added findBySlug and findByIdOrSlug methods
- ✅ `src/app/api/products/[id]/route.ts` - Updated to support slug lookups
- ✅ `src/components/ClientCategoryPage.tsx` - Updated product links to use slugs
- ✅ `src/app/api/products/generate-slugs/route.ts` - Created migration endpoint

## Notes

- The route folder still uses `[id]` but now accepts slugs
- Product interface updated in `ClientCategoryPage.tsx` to include slug field
- Slug generation is automatic based on product name
- No database migration required - works with or without slugs
